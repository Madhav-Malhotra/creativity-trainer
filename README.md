# Creativity Trainer

I'm very interested in soft skills like creativity and communication. I've also been learning about some of the best practices and psychological principles behind how creative we are. I tried to put them to use by creating four games.

You can play [here](https://creativity-trainer.web.app) if you want to try :)

------------
### Random Objects Game
Solve problems (like being stuck on Mount Everest) with three random objects. 

-----------
### Blind Drawings
Get a partner. One person describes an image verbally, another has to draw it based on just the verbal descriptions. 

-----------
### Improv Presentations
You get a random topic (ex: times you blamed your sibling for things they didn't do) and an image (ex: a flamingo). You have 60 seconds to improvise a presentation that connects the two. 

-----------
### Idea Generator
Straightforward. Come up with a bunch of ideas to weird prompts (ex: the next big Disney movie).
